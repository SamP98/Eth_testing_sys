The function of BCAI client (user end) is to
	1. create computation task. (package necessary info into the request)
	2. receive result
	3. Regenerate the AI NN locally (based on the result)

The function of BCAI provider client is to
	1. Register provider on the smart contract (startProviding)
	2. Receive computation request
	3. Generate local computation task (using TensorFlow framework and the parameter received)
	4. Monitor the task to computated.
	5. send back (by call the contract function)

\

work flow of Worker client
1. Call startProviding (send a tx to the contract)
2. Wait until being assigned a task (event monitoring)
3. Do the local task (computation)
4. Send result back (call via tx)
